# HOW TO BACKTRACK

## head commit

In Git, the [commit](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/git/commit) you are currently on is known as the HEAD commit. In many cases, the most recently made commit is the HEAD commit.

To see the HEAD commit, enter:
```
git show HEAD

```

The output of this command will display everything the [git log command](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-git/lessons/git-workflow/exercises/git-log) displays for the HEAD commit, plus all the file changes that were committed.

### Instructions
Checkpoint 1 Passed
1. Enter the command to show the HEAD commit.

Notice the output. The ghostâ€™s most recently added line is in green text.
