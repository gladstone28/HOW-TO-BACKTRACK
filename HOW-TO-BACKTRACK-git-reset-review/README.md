### HOW TO BACKTRACK

## git reset review

To better understand git reset commit_SHA, notice the diagram on the right. Each circle represents a commit.

Before reset:

- HEAD is at the most recent commit

After resetting:

- HEAD goes to a previously made commit of your choice
- The gray commits are no longer part of your project
- You have in essence rewound the projectâ€™s history
